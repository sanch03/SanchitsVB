Hey! This is where all the Visual Basic programs I make are, if you want to test any of them, download this repo in a zip (or clone it) and build the program you want in Visual Studio 2019

After downloading, and extracting the zip, run BuildAll.cmd (Make sure you have Visual Studio 2019 Installed with Visual Basic support) and it will build all the programs, you can find them in 
(Folder_where_the_Buildall.cmd_is_located)/(Project_Name)/(Project_Name)/Bin/Debug/(Project_name).exe
Hello
